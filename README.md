# Diabetes-Diet-Hub
I started this project as my coursework project but it was not completed within the original timeframe. Motivated to bring our vision to life, my friends and I have collaborated to continue the development of this project.


"The problem we are trying to solve is to simplify the process of preparing, managing, and sharing diets for specific diseases. What distinguishes DDH from other platforms on the internet? Notably, well-respected and verified doctors can have access to our community platform. This allows them to upvote, comment on, or provide suggestions for the recipes users create and share."
